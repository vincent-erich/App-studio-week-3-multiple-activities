Friendsr 1.0 - The application shows a list of available single users (the six cast members of the 1990s TV show Friends).
The user can click on each single user to see a bigger photo and get more information about that user. On the screen is a 
way to rate the user (star rating system). The application saves the ratings when the user exits the application and comes back
later. The application gracefully handles ratotation from portrait to landscape orientation.

<b>Note</b>: The application supports SDK's >= 14 (SDK 23 targeted).
